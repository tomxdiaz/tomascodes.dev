  <p>
    Hi! I'm <strong>Tomas</strong>, a full stack software engineer with a passion for building robust, scalable systems and writing clean,
    maintainable code. I specialize in modern web technologies, working primarily with Next.js/React.js on the frontend and Node.js/NestJS
    on the backend, with extensive experience integrating AWS, Shopify, Stripe, and MongoDB.
  </p>

  <h2>What I Do</h2>

  <p>
    My work focuses on designing and implementing full stack web applications that solve real-world problems. I believe in writing code that
    not only works but is also easy to understand, test, and maintain. I specialize in building modern web applications with Next.js and
    React.js, developing robust APIs with Node.js and NestJS, and integrating third-party services like AWS, Shopify, Stripe, and MongoDB to
    create complete, scalable solutions.
